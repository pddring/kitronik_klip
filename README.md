# kitronik_klip
Multi-channel robotic car controller

This python code is designed for the Kitronik Klip micro:bit which can be bought here: https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5655-klip-motor-driver-for-bbc-microbit.html 

The klip controller allows you to set the speed of 2 DC motors in either direction and I wanted some code that would work for both manual control and as a radio controller (transmitter and receiver).

This code lets you choose a channel (0-9) using button A (button B to confirm your choice) then you can use button A/B to make either motor spin forwards (either via radio control on the channel you've chosen or manually on the buggy itself).

You can see a video of it in action here: https://youtu.be/WAFdn2crXeo
